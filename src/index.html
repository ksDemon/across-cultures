        <h2>🧑 What is identity? <br> <em>How do I define it in my social context?</em></h2>

        <p>
        The complexity of identity is something I hadn’t considered until I started this course…
        </p><p>
        Who am I? It’s a simple question that I feel like I’ve never responded properly.
        </p><p>
        I would say I’m many things; I’m a student, I’m Chilean, I’m a brother, I’m a son, etcetera…
        </p><p>
        But these traits are not suitable enough to define one’s self, what truly defines you is what sets you apart from the rest, what the people around observe and say about you, and how this reflects on your own perception of yourself. The moments of our lives that mark us. And the decisions we make that ripple through time and greatly influence the way we interact and think about people and the world.
        </p><p>
        Under this line of reasoning, I would argue that one of the events that defined my childhood was the divorce of my parents due to domestic violence. This caused me to become a very untrusting person which has caused a huge ripple through my entire life, making it difficult for me to make friends or interact with new people.
        </p><p>
        The fact that I avoided social interaction for so long makes it hard for me to define my identity, because I always felt like an outcast and that became my whole identity. Now that I’ve noticed this behavior is detrimental to my mental health and have found people with similar interests in college, I’ve started to make friends and notice what they say and find interesting about me.
        </p><p>
        In the past, some of my classmates in college have said that I’m weird and impatient, so I try to be calmer and learn about what they value in a friendship. People also find it interesting how skilled I am with technology. I often get asked questions about computers and for help with any technology related problems they encounter. After all, my first and current job is to work as a computer technician in my free time.
        </p><p>
        People around me greatly influence my identity through the reflection I make on the way they perceive me. That’s how Identity constantly evolves, making it possible for individuals to fit and interact accordingly with others in their own cultural and social context.

        <h2>🌎 What is culture?</h2>
        <p>
        Culture is not something we are born with, it’s something we learn through experience, and thus may be hard to recognize and define. A good way of understanding the concept is by comparing traditions and beliefs from different places.
        </p><p>
        I picked two diverse traditional festivities in order to compare the aspects of culture present in them and have a better understanding of the concept of culture.
        </p><p>
        One foreign festivity that I investigated is the Hajj, a Muslim religious festivity that takes place in Mecca, a city in Saudi Arabia. This festivity lasts for a period of five to six days, but the date of the Hajj changes every year due to the Islamic calendar being eleven days shorter than the Gregorian calendar. During this week, millions of Muslims begin their pilgrimage to the Kaaba, a cube shaped structure referred to as the "house of god". Followers make the pilgrimages to perform a series of symbolic religious rituals as a demonstration of solidarity and submission to their god.
        </p><p>
        I will be comparing this foreign tradition with “La Fiesta de la Tirana”, a traditional Christian festivity celebrated in northern Chile created by Aymara miners that worked in copper and silver mines. It was originally linked to the Virgin of Copacabana, but in the 19th century it was transformed by Chilean saltpeter miners to worship the Virgin of Carmen. This festival is celebrated with many traditional dances. One of these dances is the “Diabladas”, a native Bolivian dance that involves colorful suits and masks which represents their god. The dances utilize fast and dynamic movements. Another dance is the “Morenos” which represents the suffering of slaves from native tribes that were forced to work as miners.
        </p><p>
        While comparing some aspects of culture in these festivities, we can see that they share some features in terms of religion. An example of this is their goal of expressing devotion towards some form of God. On the other hand, they differ in the form of art used to achieve this. While the Muslim people that participate in the Hajj perform strict and demanding rituals, the people that take part on the “Fiesta de la Tirana” express their beliefs through the music and many styles of dancing. Not only strictly expressing their religion, but also recognizing the native tribes’ traditions and beliefs. Also, another key difference between these traditions is the social class structure. While the Hajj is exclusively performed and celebrated by the Muslims, the Tirana turns out to be a very inclusive festivity, where people from all social groups can express themselves through the art and enjoy the music and dances.
        </p><p>
        Through the experience of comparing these two traditions we can realize what the key aspects of culture are, and how to identify these elements that lie within social activities in order to properly differentiate, describe and learn cultural features of a society.
